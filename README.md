# Plex Uploader
A simple desktop application built to upload content to a local Plex server without the need to ever touch a terminal.

NOTE: This approach requires SSH to be configured on the Plex server and you must be connected to the same network as the Plex server.

> [!WARNING]  
> Plex Uploader is still in early development.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project does require Tkinter to be installed when working with the source code. This must be installed at the system level.

If you'd like to run the source code yourself, you can do by running the following command:

```bash
python3 plex-uploader.py
```
